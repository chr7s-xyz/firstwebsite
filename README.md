# firstwebsite
#This website demonstrates my html ,css and basic js skills.
#The code is not clean as this project was something i did for fun. I am extremely sorry for the format too.
#The 'Novel' article and 'About Me' section can be visited as these are done with. The rest of the section and articles are empty.
#The Naming Convention isn't followed as i did this project when i started with web development and only focused on css aspects :/
#Hope you enjoyed visiting the website.
